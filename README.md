## Description
This is a console-based number guessing game written in C#. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high or too low. The game keeps track of the number of attempts and congratulates the player once they guess correctly.

Features:
Random Number Generation: The game generates a new random number each time it's run.
User Input Validation: Ensures the user enters a valid number.
Feedback System: Indicates whether the guess is too high or too low.
Attempts Tracker: Counts the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
